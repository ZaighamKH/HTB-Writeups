# Challenge Description:
Concerned about the integrity of devices produced at a remote fabrication plant, management has ordered a review of our production line. This revealed many things, including a weird embedded device in one of our serial networks. In attempting to remove it, we accidentally triggered a hardware failsafe, which resulted in the device stopping working. However, luckily we extracted the firmware prior to doing so. We need to find out what it did to the slave device it was tapped into, can you help us? The microcontroller of the device appears to be an atmega328p.

# Walk-Through:
As apparent from the description this an embedded firmware reversing challenge. The target is an atmega328p and a single file is provided called "extracted_firmware.hex". My first step is to get the datasheet for atmega328p and get information on the "extracted_firmware.hex" file using the following command:
```console
(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/BareMetalChallenge]
└─$  file extracted_firmware.hex 
extracted_firmware.hex: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
```
